## Common Ticket Tasks  
You will first arrive at the page below. This is the Tickets tab. You will now go through the most common tasks associated with tickets.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322815-b255c0d7-11b7-4ac6-8a15-6c4df5e40c1b.png)


### Creating Tickets  
Often you will first receive a call from an end user with a problem. You will then need to create a ticket yourself so that you can document the interaction. You can create a ticket by clicking the New Ticket button in the upper right.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322848-d0731fa5-c5c0-421f-b568-b62dc0702326.png)

You can now go through the process of creating a ticket. The Contact field is where you would normally add the user’s name. For the purposes of the lab, you can add your user account here. For the summary and description, you can enter a generic scenario like a slow computer. Under Assignee, you can add your user account since you are the one handling the incident. Next choose a priority and category. Then click Create to continue.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322891-08483f79-66fe-4e8a-9d3d-b12c2513a75f.png)

You will now see the newly created ticket in the Tickets tab. Click on it to open the ticket.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322900-615fbc6b-2008-47ca-a194-3b5058b0cb00.png)

A menu will popup on the right. This will allow you to edit the Attributes for this ticket.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322910-9e0f5d0a-fac2-4b8b-854f-85544ede2dc7.png)


## Assigning / Escalating Tickets  
Sometimes you will get a ticket that you cannot solve yourself or is outside your scope of work. Examples of this might included the company’s web servers being down. You will need to assign that ticket to the right department. You can either assign it to the entire department or to a specific person in that department. 

You can assign a ticket by clicking the dropdown menu under the Assignee field. You can then search for the specific department or person you want to assign the ticket to.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322945-bbce8ba9-722f-4858-91ea-d147e447e5a5.png)

## Changing Ticket Priority  
When you first receive a ticket, you will have to look at the priority assigned to it and decide if its correct for that issue. Often end users will assign the wrong priority to the tickets they submit. They may want their tickets to be resolved right away so they place a higher priority in hopes it gets addressed faster. 

To change the priority of a ticket. Click on the drop-down menu under the Priority menu. You can now change it to the appropriate level.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322987-efd2e307-67f7-426d-8ac8-3d63acee369d.png)  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210322999-97685f8e-20af-4941-8549-622d4299ad30.png)  


## Changing Ticket Due Date  
If there is a service level agreement in place, you will have a certain time frame to resolve tickets. If not, then the company may be in breach of the SLA. To make sure tickets don’t fall through the gaps, you should assign a due date to tickets. 

To change the due date of a ticket. Click on the Due Date field. You can now change it to a date that is reasonable for a ticket of that priority to be resolved.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210323038-0d3b159e-358d-492c-8f77-61c68901d4d1.png)  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210323046-a7205ca2-cde3-44cc-ab8a-3aa2c5c9cd29.png)  


## Changing Time Spent on Ticket  
Noting the time spent working on a ticket will help management identify what tickets are occupying the most time. This can then help identify what problems might be more systematic and need closer attention. Management can then take steps to prevent those from arising as much over the long term.

You can click the predefined time buttons or click Custom to enter a more specific number.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210323056-1ed3e76c-db5e-4c3a-bf9c-81705cc16732.png)


## Add Tasks to Tickets  
When dealing with more complex tasks, it is helpful to document the steps you want to take to resolve the problem. This is also helpful to know what steps you or another colleague have already taken.

Add a task by entering it in the text field under the Tasks attribute. You can click the box next to a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will have a strike-through over them.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210323112-30bfc6f5-01f4-488a-a0e5-07f70b209a6d.png)


## Documenting Tickets  
As you take steps to complete a ticket, its important to document the interaction. This will help others understand the steps you took to resolve this particular ticket. This is helpful for others who want to reference this ticket to understand how to solve similar problems in the future. 

The documentation area is on the left side of the page when you click on the ticket. Here you can type a public response that is visible to the user or type an internal note that is for documentation purposes.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121589466/210323137-281b82b1-e2b1-401f-9118-eb62878935f1.png)


## Changing Ticket Status  
Once a problem is resolved, you can now close the ticket by setting the status to Closed. Sometimes you might have to wait on something before you can complete a ticket. This can be waiting for a replacement keyboard to be shipped. For this scenario, you can set the ticket to Waiting.

You can change the status of a ticket by clicking on the drop-down menu under Status.

## Remote Assistance  
To resolve an issue for an end user, its useful to be able to see their screen or even take control of the machine to fix the problem. You can do this by using the remote assistance features in Spiceworks. This feature uses an intergration with Zoho Assist.

### Setup remote assistance  
The easiest way to acess the remote assistance feature is to click on the ticket and then click on the Remote sesson button on the right.

# Knowledge Base  
The most important tool in any ticketing system is the knowledge base. This is where you can write articles on how to troubleshoot and solve common problems. This helps everyone on your team and makes resolving tickets much easier. As the knowledge base grows, it becomes the go-to place to quickly find solutions to common problems. It also serves as a reference where you can look at how similar problems have been solved previously. Then you can apply that methodology to solve the ticket you are working on.

Click the Knowledge Base tab to open it up.

# Inventory Management  
Tracking and managing devices in an organization plays an important role in supporting the organization. The inventory management tab in Spiceworks allows you to easily scan your network for all devices. You can then associate those devices with tickets.
